Detection of Emotions Through Image Processing:

Project Description:

This project enables real-time facial emotion detection using a webcam. By leveraging image processing techniques and deep learning, it analyzes facial expressions and identifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, and more.

Features:

1)Real-time emotion detection using a webcam.
2)Uses DeepFace for emotion recognition.
3)Implemented with OpenCV for image processing.
4)Works on multiple emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.
5)Simple and efficient Python-based implementation.

Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, DeepFace, NumPy, Matplotlib

Framework: Deep Learning (Keras/TensorFlow - used internally by DeepFace)
